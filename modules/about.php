	<h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The two fundamental rules that the 356 team goes by are, “Vex is Life” and “DWWGI”. The term, “Vex is Life” means that we are here to give robotics our full attention, it is our first priority. This is because we know we lack experience in the Vex field and in robotics in general. If we want to succed, we have to matchup and prevail against other teams. We have to work twice as hard to get to their level and then do even better. The second term, “DDWGI” stands for, ”don’t worry we got it”. This simply means we want to keep a positive mindset and not to stress. Just get the work done!</p>
